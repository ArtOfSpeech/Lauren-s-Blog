                    The "Annoited People", also known as <em>"Gullah" or "GeeChee"</em>, are native to the islands that outline North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. We are strongly connected to our roots in West Africa. We maintained many traditions such as putting empty bottles on trees. The bottles are placed on a tree branch to capture mischievous spirits at night. According to folktale, the spirits become enamored with the colors of the bottles that illuminate by moonlight, then when the sun comes up they are caught and fade away by sun rays. There are also traditions such as creating sweetgrass baskets, which can be seein South Carolina in areas such as Charleston as well as Hilton Head Island. <br>

        <h2>Pivoting Careers from Therapy</h2>
        <p id= "pivot"> As a professor once said to me, “… being a Speech Language Pathologist involves wearing many hats.” He referred to the use of many skills to perform the tasks as a speech language pathologist. Those skills take time to develop. They can also compliment a wide variety of professions outside of speech language pathology. At some point in the profession, many of us have thought about trying something new to pursue or thinking about taking a break from speech language pathology. The fear of not having transferable skills can really be a hurdle to embracing a new profession. Think about all of the skills that you have as a professional. The list can go on past 11. Each one of these skills has value. Employers look for someone with more than one year worth of experience in the skill sets mentioned below. Think about how long you have used theses skills and see where you fit with respect to a new career. You can often times find a matching position by listing skills on LinkedIn or Glassdoor.</p>
